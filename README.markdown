# Bangalore Open Data Repository
Bangalore Open Data Repository is repository of data, code and related artifacts that I have collected in my personal capacity ( [My personal introductory blog post](http://thejeshgn.com/2012/09/15/introducing-bangalore-open-data-repository/) ). Its targeted at data enthusiasts, data scientists, researchers and developers who are interested in public data related to Bangalore. Its maintained as a mercurial repository and available at [http://code.thejeshgn.com/bangalore](http://code.thejeshgn.com/bangalore). If you are a developer then you can clone 

	hg clone http://code.thejeshgn.com/bangalore

you can send me a pull request if you have patched any code or cleaned up the data.

If you are not interested in history but just need a snap shot then you can download the whole project as [a zip file](http://code.thejeshgn.com/bangalore/get/tip.zip) at
